# README

This is a *userscript* as it that looks into the DOM of facebook pages to find specific patterns in order to delete ads that are located within the timeline.

## TODO list:

- Publish as a userscript.
- Make a Chrome extension. Publish it.
    * Need icons (19, 48, 128, disabled) (replace current ones, they're just for testing, I stole them from my brother!) =D
- Support multiple languages (`texts` in hard?)
- Use a DB of sort to share `texts` (acts as a blacklist)
- Settings to update the blacklist.

The current files may look like a Chrome Extension, but it's not one yet.
