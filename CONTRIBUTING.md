# CONTRIBUTING

- If you want to add features, please first open an issue so we can discuss what you want to do and maybe how. Once it's sorted feel free to make a PR.
- If you don't care about asking first then do it your way but beware *I may refuse the PR*.
- Keep the same "styling code" (pascalCase) and language. (coffee)
- Thanks for your help! :)
